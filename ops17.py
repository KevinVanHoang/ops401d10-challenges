# Script Name:                  Ops Challenge: Automated Brute Force Wordlist Attack Tool Part 2 of 3
# Author:                       Kevin Hoang
# Date of latest revision:      1/30/2024
# Purpose:                      Script that creates a  a custom tool that performs brute force attacks to better 
#                               understand the types of automation employed by adversaries.
# Execution:                    ops16.py
# Resources:                    https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-cybersecurity-401d10/blob/main/class-16/challenges/DEMO.md
