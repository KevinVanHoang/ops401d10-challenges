# Script Name:                  Network Security Tool with Scapy Part 3 of 3
# Author:                       Kevin Hoang
# Date of latest revision:      1/24w/2024
# Purpose:                      Script that creates a The final iteration of your network scanning tool will perform the following:
#                               Ping an IP address determined by the user.
#                               If the host exists, scan its ports and determine if any are open.
# Execution:                    ops13.py
# Resources:                    https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-cybersecurity-401d10/blob/main/class-06/challenges/DEMO.md
